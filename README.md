<em>Browse my site here --> https://world-wine-web.herokuapp.com/

I created this web application for my second individual project for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. We were tasked to create a CRUD system using everything we had learnt in the last 5 weeks about front and back end web development. We were given about a week to create a functioning application complete with at least 3 Models, Views, Controllers, Gems and site deployment (Heroku).

<br>

## For Cellar Owners:

• Build, edit and share your own collection of favourite wines and reviews - and share them with the world!
