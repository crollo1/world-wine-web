<h1> World-Wine-Web </h1>
<hr>
World-Wine-Web is a platform to share the very best information on wine varietals, vintages, regions and reviews - complete with your very own <strong>Cellar</strong>, where you can build your own collection!

I created this web application for my second individual project for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. We were tasked to create a CRUD system using everything we had learnt in the last 5 weeks about front and back end web development. We were given about a week and a half to create a functioning application complete with Models (at least 3), Views, Controllers, Gems and site deployment (Heroku).

## For Cellar Owners:
<hr>
• Build, edit and share your own collection of favourite wines and reviews - and share them with the world!
